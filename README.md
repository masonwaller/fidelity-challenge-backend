I built this backend for a Caesar Cipher web application.  The purpose of this project was to be able to easily cipher strings of your choosing.  I built htis app using Nestjs, TypeScript, and Jest.  It is a simple backend that ciphers but does not save instances to a database, so data will be lost anytime you restart the server.  This was my first time using all these languages/frameworks and was testing my knowledge on the matter.
